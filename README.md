📈 Suggestions to Increase Sales
1. Focus on Peak Days & Months
Run targeted campaigns on Fridays and Saturdays
Plan promotions during May and July, when customer activity peaks

2. Promote Large Pizzas
Since Large size drives the most revenue, create bundles or combo deals around large-sized pizzas

3. Expand Popular Variants
Upsell or create variations of Classic Deluxe, Thai Chicken, and Barbecue Chicken, which are the most sold and highest revenue generators

4. Improve Visibility of Supreme & Chicken Categories
Both categories are close to Classic in terms of contribution — consider category-specific promotions or loyalty points

5. Encourage Add-ons
With an average of 2.32 pizzas per order, adding side options (garlic bread, drinks) could raise Average Order Value further

🚫 Avoidables & Optimization Areas
1. Discontinue or Rework Low Performers
Brie Carre Pizza, The Mediterranean, and The Spinach Pizza are underperforming. Consider:
Discontinuing
Revamping recipe or marketing
Offering as limited-time or promotional items only

2. Rethink Small and XXL Sizes
Very low contribution to sales – consider:
Removing from the menu
Positioning as novelty options rather than regular offerings

3. Smooth Out Seasonal Dips
Launch special offers during low-sales months (September, October) to boost traffic
Partner with local events or holidays in those months

4. Optimize Inventory
Use sales trends to better plan inventory, especially around best-selling pizzas and large sizes
